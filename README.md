# Replication Prices Investigation

This project aimed to investigate the role of delta-hedging on option price accuracy. There are a lot of assumptions that go into the Black-Scholes-Merton theory that aren't realistic when trading options. In this investigation, I wanted to look at what happens to the distribution of option prices when we break those assumptions and how that would affect a strategy that calculates option prices via discrete delta-hedging.
